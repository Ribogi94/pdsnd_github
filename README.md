### Description
This project allows with the use of python to **explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States** â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
In an interactive way you can decide what statistics should be shown. This includes:
* Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?
* Would you like to filter the data by month, day, or not at all?
* (If they chose month) Which month - January, February, March, April, May, or June?
* (If they chose day) Which day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday?


### How it works?
The user input get evaluated regarding different options for filtering. If an invalid option was chosen the script will evaluate and ask the user for a correct value. If the set of user inputs for filtering are okay this will generate the required set of filtered data for the necessary statistic analysis. With this filtered data the program performs the necessary functions/statistic information regarding bike data and the user input.


### Install/used packages
To run this project you need:
* Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
* A text editor, like Sublime or Atom.
* A terminal application.


### Files used
The data for this project was provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. This allows us to compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.
The raw data for analysis can be found here:
* [here](https://divvybikes.com/system-data)
* [here](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data)
* [here](https://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data)


This data was wrangled and converted into three similar csv files used for analysis. They are not included in this repository!


### Issues
No issues known at the moment. Feel free to find them!
